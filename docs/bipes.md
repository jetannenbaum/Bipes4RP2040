# An Introduction to BIPES

BIPES: A Block-based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems is an open source and free platform created for programming various microcontrollers including the Raspberry Pi Pico without code.

The original application was created by a team led by Rafael Aroca, a professor at the Federal University at SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar) in Brazil.  He was kind enough to allow others (including me) to add to the application, expanding the capabilities of the web based application.  

## Why use BIPES?

BIPES hides the complexity of the MicroPython programming language by allowing users to program the Raspberry Pi Pico via an easy to use graphical interface. BIPES has several built in libraries that make adding accessories to your microcontroller simple. The underlying code can be viewed in the console, giving the interested user the ability to learn as they build on coding concepts.

## Working with BIPES

Working with BIPES is easy, since it web based and runs in most browsers.  Nothing is required to download on to your computer.  BIPES can be found here: [https://bipes.net.br/pico/ui/](https://bipes.net.br/pico/ui/)
