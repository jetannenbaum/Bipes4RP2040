## Program Basics

* Introduce the Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller
* Install the MicroPython Interpreter
* Introduce BIPES, a Block based Integrated Program for Embedded Systems
* Demonstrate using BIPES:
    * Demonstate different computational concepts
    * Connect the Pico to different components
