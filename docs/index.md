## Program Basics

* Introducing the Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller
* Install the MicroPython interpreter
* What is BIPES, a Block based Integrated Program for Embedded Systems?
* Demonstration using BIPES:
    * Demonstate different computational concepts
         * Variables
         * Loops
         * Conditionals
         * Functions
         * Lists
    * Connect the Pico to different components
         * A list of components
         * Using a prototyping board
